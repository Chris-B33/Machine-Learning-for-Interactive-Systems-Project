## Description
This was a project created by Mark and I for the module "Machine Learning for Interactive Systems".<br>
We were given a list of topics to choose from and had to make a project based on one of them. We chose "Voice Recognition".<br>
We decided to build a game where you control Scooby Doo trying to catch Scooby Snacks that are falling from the sky using your voice.<br>
It was trained on Mark's voice to recognize "Left" and "Right", as well as recognize his tone of voice, like if it was more frantic or calm sounding. That influences the speed at which the character moves.
